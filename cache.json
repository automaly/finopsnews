This gives companies the ability to better and faster determine whether additional inventory is needed within a picking zone. The setup for the new feature is very similar to location-based replenishment. As new replenishment template is created for min/max replenishment, the user can simply specify whether the threshold should be evaluated per Location or per Zone. In case of zones, specific zones are then added to the Zone selection query and those will be evaluated by the newly created replenishment template when processed. Just like location-based min/max replenishment, the zone-based min/max replenishment is based on setting up a minimum threshold of inventory that triggers the creation of replenishment work order for selected items and item variants. In return, replenishment will be created for quantity that increases inventory up to the desired zone maximum threshold.",

I'd list the ways of inserting data in X++ as follows:\nSingle record insert - Most common use case, happens all the time. you open a transaction, set values on a buffer, tell it to insert(), close the transaction.\nMulti record insert - This is inserting multiple records at a time in a single transaction.\nInsert_RecordSet - This is using bypassing using a specific buffer and instead attempting to insert data more directly into the database.

If i want to sync to a new repo, Git would like that new repo to be a new folder on my local file system. F&O VMs are created with the PackagesLocalDirectory already there and full of code.

However, if you try to do it using addLink method:\nqbdsInventBatch.clearDynalinks();\nqbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventDim, inventBatchId), fieldNum(InventBatch, inventBatchId));\nqbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventSum, ItemId), fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));\nInvalid Field/Related field combination\":\n\n\nThere are a few tricks how this can be resolved:\n\n\n1.

Start query from Inventbatch data source and then join to it InventSum and InventDim. However, considering the example above in most cases it will not be logical. But it might work in your case.\n3. Use extended ranges. The solution will have the following look:\nQueryBuildRange qbrItemId = SysQuery::findOrCreateRange(qbdsInventBatch, fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));\nstr itemIdRange = strFmt('(%1.%2=%3.%4)', qbdsInventBatch.name(), fieldStr(InventBatch, ItemId), _inventSum_DS_Query.dataSourceName(formDataSourceStr(InventOnhandItem, InventSum)).name(), fieldStr(InventSum, ItemId));\nqbrItemId.value(itemIdRange);\nAdditional query build extended range example",

          "description": "Union query may be a very efficient and useful option when you need to fetch similar data fields from different tables. A good example of this may be the case when you to gather information about project related transactions as they can be of different types, like, expenses, fees, items, etc. \nSay, we need to render some report collecting all these different types of transaction that can be posted against a given project and group them by a given financial dimension value in Project group. Let's see how Union query can help us.\nIn order to better understand the goal, you can take a look to the standard form ProjInvoiceJournal which perfectly explains how all these table relate to each other. \n\nMost of them contain the same set of fields, and we simply need to get some of them into one view to populate by the report data provider.\nSo, at the first step, let's create all necessary queries for the source Project transaction related tables. Pick up the first and create a simple query as depicted. \n\n\n\nThen create a view based on this query. \n\nThen pick up the next and do the same.\n\n\nComplete these two steps for all necessary transaction types.\nNow you can create a Union query and add all your views together as they have the same set of fields.\n\n\nIf you need to distinguish them later who is who, say, in computed column methods, you can use  unionAllBranchId field, but this is out of the current focus.\n\nFinally you can elaborate it by adding a new view based on the latter with a simple SUM aggregation for Amount field.\n\n\nBasically, you achieve your goal with no coding.\nI am not going into details about the whole project, which you can get by this URL https://github.com/wojzeh/tmxProjectSalesPerSegment. Ping me, if you have any questions.\n\n\nRelated topics: \nComputed column for union values from multiple outer joined data sources in view",

So I decided to create a new version of it for D365FO.\nIt combines supporting for both lookup and lookupReference methods: performFormLookup and performFormReferenceLookup.\nVania added a tutorial form to his class, so did I. There is a form in the project, which shows how unbounded form controls can be looked up with fields and display methods from joined tables as well as the case with aggregation and a CustTable data source to demonstrate a lookup for a reference group.\n\n\n\nTake note that I did not implement resolving and have…",

To connect to test environment RDP, you need to create Whitelist rule for your IP address \n\nConnect RDP and open SSMS\n\nConnect to SQL server using Server name from LCS and add the prefix to SQL server name – servername.database.windows.net\n\nCreate a new query to test DB\nBelow query will create a new user that will be used for debugging\nCREATE USER devtempuser WITH PASSWORD = ‘pass@word1’\nEXEC sp_addrolemember ‘db_owner’, ‘devtempuser’\n\n\nWhitelist your IP address\nSelect new query against Master DB\nexec sp_set_firewall_rule N’DEVNAME’, ‘IP’, ‘IP’ \n\nStop IIS, WWW service and Batch Service\nOpen IIS and stop the service. Open run and enter services.msc and stop WWW and Microsoft D365 batch service\n\nEdit Web config\nGo to C:\\AosService\\webroot\\web.config and save the original file somewhere else as backup. Modify 4 Keys as per the below screenshot.\nYou can either comment original configuration or delete it and add new configuration of the sandbox environment\n\nStart IIS and WWW services\nStart IIS and WWW service stopped in step 5. Don’t start batch service.\n\nOpen the development environment AX URL\nIf you get 503 unavailable error, go to CMD(as admin) and type IISRESET\n\nDebug\nNow sandbox environment is connected to your development environment. You can simply open Visual studio to add breakpoints to X++ object and attach w3wp.exe service to debug.\n\nThanks Pawan Deep SinghI \n\nReference: https://axparadise.com/how-to-debug-the-sandbox-test-environment-in-d365fo/",

          "description": "One thing I appreciate about subscriptions is the automatic renewal process. It's nice to sign up for a subscription and not have to worry about manually renewing every time the contract period is up. This brings in automatic revenue for the company and keeps the hassle of manually renewing out of everyone's hands. \nFortunately, the process for setting up renewals in Subscription billing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations is fairly simple to execute as well. Let's dive in! \n\n\nRenewing Subscriptions\nThe process to renew a subscription set up in D365FO Subscription billing is done on the Billing schedule itself. When setting up your customer's billing schedule, there is a button to Renew automatically on the Billing schedule header. If this subscription should be renewed automatically, select this toggle and specify how many lines to add per renewal. \n\n\nSet the toggle for Renew automatically and specify how many lines to add per renewal\n\n\nIn my example above, I have a short billing cycle set for one quarter. I set the toggle for Renew automatically to Yes and Lines to add per renewal to 1. \nOnce I invoiced the period, a new renewal line gets added to the Renewal section in the Line details for the line being renewed. The line shows who renewed it, the date it was renewed, and that it is, in fact, a renewal. \n\n\nSee the renewals in Line details\n\n\nIf I navigate to View billing detail on the line, there is now a new billing line to be invoiced. This is the first automatic renewal line! \n\n\nBilling details now show a new line to be invoiced\n\n\nAutomatic renewals allow users to set up a billing schedule and continually renew the subscription until the customer decides to terminate it.",

          "description": "From time to time, we have all ended a subscription service. It happens - maybe the service doesn't meet your needs anymore. Perhaps it has gotten too expensive. Regardless of the reason, it is a common occurrence and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance's Subscription billing module has a solution for terminating subscriptions.\nNow you are probably thinking, \"Oh great, something complex to add to my never-ending duties...\" \nNope! Terminating a Billing schedule in the Subscription billing module is easy, and I am going to walk through it. \n\n\n\"I'll be back... when I am ready to subscribe again\"\n\n\nTerminating the Billing Schedule\n\n\nWithin the Billing schedule, you may notice that there are options surrounding Terminations. When you initially set up the Billing schedule, a Termination type will default onto the Billing schedule header. This field can be modified.\n\n\n\n\nThe three options are:\n\n\n\nAdjust schedule\nBill remaining\nNo adjustment\n\n\n\nThe defaulted Termination type comes from the Recurring contract billing parameters found at Subscription billing > Recurring contract billing > Setup > Recurring contract billing parameters. \n\n\n\n\nRecurring contract billing parameters\n\n\n\nTerminating Recurring Billing\n\n\nOnce on the Billing schedule screen for your Customer, there is an option to Terminate in the Billing schedule tab on the ribbon.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the Terminate dropdown is selected, there are options to: \n\n\n\nSelect a Termination date\nSelect the Termination type\nSelect the Credit option\nChoose to Prorate daily (or not)\nSelect a Reason code\nProvide Termination notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the fields are populated, select to Terminate or Terminate with refund. All billing schedule lines will be terminated based on the date selected. \n\n\n\n\nOnce the Termination is complete, a notification will alert you to how many lines were terminated, and Termination can be removed from the account by selecting Remove termination in the ribbon.",

          "description": "When importing Workers into Dynamics 365 Human Resources (now in D365FO), you populate the Worker data entity with as much information as possible. Then, start the import using Data management and after the import is complete, you check Human resources > Workers > Workers, and there are no records to be found. The import says it was successful, so where did the worker records go?\nIf you look around, you will find them in the Workers without employment filtered view (Human resources > Workers > Workers without employment.) \n\n\n\n\n\nGreat, the records made it into the system, but I don't want to touch each record and add employment dates. How do we use the Data management functionality to add \"employment\" to these worker records?\n\n\nEmployment V2 Data Entity\n\n\nA data entity called Employment V2 allows you to update the Workers' employment through Data management instead of old-fashioned manual entry. The mapping for the Employment V2 Data entity looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe fields within the mapping of the Employment V2 data entity include: \n\n\nCalendarID\nDimensionDisplayValue\nEmploymentEndDate\nEmploymentStartDate\nLegalEntityID\nPersonnelNumber\nRegulatoryEstablishmentID\nWorkerType\n\n\n\nDepending on your setup, the data within the Employment V2 data entity can be as simple as this screenshot. \n\n\n\nOnce the Employment V2 data entity is imported, the Worker records will become active in the Human resources > Workers > Workers view in the Dynamics 365 Human Resources module.",

          "description": "Something happened while I wasn't looking and now we have a clearer sequencing of Credit management Blocking rules. This has been a much-needed change, and I am happy to report on it!\nSequencing of Blocking Rules\n\n\nIn the past, Blocking rules in Credit management have all run, regardless of what happened on another Blocking rule. \nThis could cause frustration if a company wanted to stop processing once specific criteria had been met. \nAs of version 10.0.21, you may have noticed some new options within the Blocking rules form. \nWhen setting up Blocking rules, there is a new column within all Blocking rules labeled \"Release sales order.\" This can only be enabled on an Exclusion rule type.\n\n\nWhat this \"Release sales order\" toggle does, is it allows for an Exclusion rule to bypass all other Blocking rules and process the Sales order if it meets the Exclusion criteria. \nTypically, Blocking rules get processed before Exclusion rules, and an Exclusion rule on the same level as the Blocking rule will not exclude that Blocking rule. This is the exception to that rule. \n\n\nNew Sequence of Blocking Rules\n\n\nExclusion rule with Release Sales order checked\nBlocking rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)\nExclusion rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)\n\n\nHaving rules in place surrounding how Blocking rules are run is a massive improvement. Here is the link to the documentation within Microsoft Docs: Credit holds for sales orders - Finance | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Docs",

          "description": "Some big changes were made to Credit management in recent versions that need to be addressed. One of which is the following parameter: \nBypass inventory reservations\n\n\n\n\nA new parameter has appeared called Bypass inventory reservations, but what does it mean?\n\n\n\n\nRelease to Warehouse Credit Management Hold\n\n\nThere have been some observations made that when using the Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint, the Sales order gets stuck in an infinite loop of going back on Credit hold after being released. This is occurring even if the order is Released to warehouse within the grace days defined. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint in Credit and collections parameters\n\n\n\nMicrosoft has quietly released a fix for this in version 10.0.19 that is called Bypass inventory reservations. When this is enabled in the Credit and collections parameters, it will disregard inventory reservations when checking credit management blocking rules. Likewise, it will enable checkpoint grace periods regardless of inventory reservation quantity. \n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the Bypass inventory reservations parameter to avoid the Release to warehouse credit hold loop!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis has been a lifesaver for people who have found themselves stuck in an endless loop of Credit management holds when they try to release their Sales order from Credit hold then try to Release to warehouse!",
