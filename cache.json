I have utilized the 'When a HTTP request is received' trigger.\n\n\n\n\n2. Initialized the 2 variables(Array, string type).\n\n\n\n\n3. I have used a 'for-each' loop to iterate through each record, passing the HTTP response body as input. Inside the loop, I have parsed the current record.\n\n\n4. After parsing, I updated the record in F&O using the 'update record' trigger.\n\n\n5. If an update is successful, I am assigning a success status to the 'message' variable.\n    If the update fails, I am parsing the error and sending it to the 'message' variable.\n\n\n\n    While parsing the error I have used the below JSON.\n\n    {\n\t\"status\": 400,\n\t\"message\": \"An error has occurred.

Configure run after options for Append to the array variable has set up in the below.\n\n\n7. After the for loop, I used the 'HTTP Response' action. In the response body, I converted the array into a JSON string.\n\njson(string(variables('OutputJson')))\n\n\n8.

Usually, the primary key field of one table appears as a foreign key field of the related table. The table with the primary key is called the parent table. The table with the foreign key is called the child table.\n\n\n\nA relation on a table can restrict the rows in the table or restrict the values that can be in a particular field. A common use of relations is to associate rows in one table with corresponding rows in another table. Relations enable many forms to display data from multiple tables. Some relations restrict the rows in the table by testing the values in each row against constant values. Other relations restrict the rows by comparing values …",

However, if you try to do it using addLink method:\nqbdsInventBatch.clearDynalinks();\nqbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventDim, inventBatchId), fieldNum(InventBatch, inventBatchId));\nqbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventSum, ItemId), fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));\nInvalid Field/Related field combination\":\n\n\nThere are a few tricks how this can be resolved:\n\n\n1. Create a view from InventSum and InventDim and use it as a single data source and then join InventBatch to it.\n2. Start query from Inventbatch data source and then join to it InventSum and InventDim. However, considering the example above in most cases it will not be logical. But it might work in your case.\n3. Use extended ranges. The solution will have the following look:\nQueryBuildRange qbrItemId = SysQuery::findOrCreateRange(qbdsInventBatch, fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));\nstr itemIdRange = strFmt('(%1.%2=%3.%4)', qbdsInventBatch.name(), fieldStr(InventBatch, ItemId), _inventSum_DS_Query.dataSourceName(formDataSourceStr(InventOnhandItem, InventSum)).name(), fieldStr(InventSum, ItemId));\nqbrItemId.value(itemIdRange);\nAdditional query build extended range example",

They gather data breadcrumbs from your daily activities, providing analysis of your movement patterns. This isn’t a generic data compilation, but a near-accurate reflection of your physical activity during a specific period.\nIn the future, it’s conceivable that these apps might be equipped with an AI companion, or Copilot, to guide your next steps based on your past activities. It could suggest rest days or additional exercise to help you achieve your personal health goals.\nThis concept of performance evaluation based on collected data is the bedrock of process mining and process comparison. Our Copilot functionality adds a layer of assistance, enabling you to make informed decisions about your warehouse operations.\nIn this context, Copilot can help you optimize warehouse processes. It can identify bottlenecks in certain processes or compare different methods to achieve the same goal, empowering you to choose the most optimal method for your specific case.\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the essence of this feature, its intended audience, and how and why you should leverage it for your warehousing operations.\nThe post Process Advisor for Supply Chain and Warehousing. appeared first on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Blog.",

          "description": "Union query may be a very efficient and useful option when you need to fetch similar data fields from different tables. A good example of this may be the case when you to gather information about project related transactions as they can be of different types, like, expenses, fees, items, etc. \nSay, we need to render some report collecting all these different types of transaction that can be posted against a given project and group them by a given financial dimension value in Project group. Let's see how Union query can help us.\nIn order to better understand the goal, you can take a look to the standard form ProjInvoiceJournal which perfectly explains how all these table relate to each other. \n\nMost of them contain the same set of fields, and we simply need to get some of them into one view to populate by the report data provider.\nSo, at the first step, let's create all necessary queries for the source Project transaction related tables. Pick up the first and create a simple query as depicted. \n\n\n\nThen create a view based on this query. \n\nThen pick up the next and do the same.\n\n\nComplete these two steps for all necessary transaction types.\nNow you can create a Union query and add all your views together as they have the same set of fields.\n\n\nIf you need to distinguish them later who is who, say, in computed column methods, you can use  unionAllBranchId field, but this is out of the current focus.\n\nFinally you can elaborate it by adding a new view based on the latter with a simple SUM aggregation for Amount field.\n\n\nBasically, you achieve your goal with no coding.\nI am not going into details about the whole project, which you can get by this URL https://github.com/wojzeh/tmxProjectSalesPerSegment. Ping me, if you have any questions.\n\n\nRelated topics: \nComputed column for union values from multiple outer joined data sources in view",

There is a form in the project, which shows how unbounded form controls can be looked up with fields and display methods from joined tables as well as the case with aggregation and a CustTable data source to demonstrate a lookup for a reference group.\n\n\n\nTake note that I did not implement resolving and have…",

It's easy to neglect them, but we should make sure to take care of them.\nOne way to acknowledge the team's devotion is by implementing a reward and recognition scheme.\nThe project leadership team often lacks understanding and support for the individual team members, which can lead to problems like crises that may arise during a project.\nOne way to motivate a team member is to support and encourage them. Part of leadership is making sure that everyone knows that you're standing alongside them and will be by their side as the project progresses.\nOne other important motivator is getting appreciated for your work by a custome…",

It is inevitable that they will face this problem at some point.\nBefore deploying any resources into the project, organizations must invest in training and skills development.\nA project without refactoring will quickly become inefficient and error-prone. As a result, your team's morale will be lower, design & build phase time will increase, and your implementation success rate will be slowed down.\nAlthough the team had a longer learning curve than anticipated, they were able to get up to speed quickly.

To connect to test environment RDP, you need to create Whitelist rule for your IP address \n\nConnect RDP and open SSMS\n\nConnect to SQL server using Server name from LCS and add the prefix to SQL server name – servername.database.windows.net\n\nCreate a new query to test DB\nBelow query will create a new user that will be used for debugging\nCREATE USER devtempuser WITH PASSWORD = ‘pass@word1’\nEXEC sp_addrolemember ‘db_owner’, ‘devtempuser’\n\n\nWhitelist your IP address\nSelect new query against Master DB\nexec sp_set_firewall_rule N’DEVNAME’, ‘IP’, ‘IP’ \n\nStop IIS, WWW service and Batch Service\nOpen IIS and stop the service. Open run and enter services.msc and stop WWW and Microsoft D365 batch service\n\nEdit Web config\nGo to C:\\AosService\\webroot\\web.config and save the original file somewhere else as backup. Modify 4 Keys as per the below screenshot.\nYou can either comment original configuration or delete it and add new configuration of the sandbox environment\n\nStart IIS and WWW services\nStart IIS and WWW service stopped in step 5. Don’t start batch service.\n\nOpen the development environment AX URL\nIf you get 503 unavailable error, go to CMD(as admin) and type IISRESET\n\nDebug\nNow sandbox environment is connected to your development environment. You can simply open Visual studio to add breakpoints to X++ object and attach w3wp.exe service to debug.\n\nThanks Pawan Deep SinghI \n\nReference: https://axparadise.com/how-to-debug-the-sandbox-test-environment-in-d365fo/",

          "description": "One thing I appreciate about subscriptions is the automatic renewal process. It's nice to sign up for a subscription and not have to worry about manually renewing every time the contract period is up. This brings in automatic revenue for the company and keeps the hassle of manually renewing out of everyone's hands. \nFortunately, the process for setting up renewals in Subscription billing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations is fairly simple to execute as well. Let's dive in! \n\n\nRenewing Subscriptions\nThe process to renew a subscription set up in D365FO Subscription billing is done on the Billing schedule itself. When setting up your customer's billing schedule, there is a button to Renew automatically on the Billing schedule header. If this subscription should be renewed automatically, select this toggle and specify how many lines to add per renewal. \n\n\nSet the toggle for Renew automatically and specify how many lines to add per renewal\n\n\nIn my example above, I have a short billing cycle set for one quarter. I set the toggle for Renew automatically to Yes and Lines to add per renewal to 1. \nOnce I invoiced the period, a new renewal line gets added to the Renewal section in the Line details for the line being renewed. The line shows who renewed it, the date it was renewed, and that it is, in fact, a renewal. \n\n\nSee the renewals in Line details\n\n\nIf I navigate to View billing detail on the line, there is now a new billing line to be invoiced. This is the first automatic renewal line! \n\n\nBilling details now show a new line to be invoiced\n\n\nAutomatic renewals allow users to set up a billing schedule and continually renew the subscription until the customer decides to terminate it.",

          "description": "From time to time, we have all ended a subscription service. It happens - maybe the service doesn't meet your needs anymore. Perhaps it has gotten too expensive. Regardless of the reason, it is a common occurrence and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance's Subscription billing module has a solution for terminating subscriptions.\nNow you are probably thinking, \"Oh great, something complex to add to my never-ending duties...\" \nNope! Terminating a Billing schedule in the Subscription billing module is easy, and I am going to walk through it. \n\n\n\"I'll be back... when I am ready to subscribe again\"\n\n\nTerminating the Billing Schedule\n\n\nWithin the Billing schedule, you may notice that there are options surrounding Terminations. When you initially set up the Billing schedule, a Termination type will default onto the Billing schedule header. This field can be modified.\n\n\n\n\nThe three options are:\n\n\n\nAdjust schedule\nBill remaining\nNo adjustment\n\n\n\nThe defaulted Termination type comes from the Recurring contract billing parameters found at Subscription billing > Recurring contract billing > Setup > Recurring contract billing parameters. \n\n\n\n\nRecurring contract billing parameters\n\n\n\nTerminating Recurring Billing\n\n\nOnce on the Billing schedule screen for your Customer, there is an option to Terminate in the Billing schedule tab on the ribbon.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the Terminate dropdown is selected, there are options to: \n\n\n\nSelect a Termination date\nSelect the Termination type\nSelect the Credit option\nChoose to Prorate daily (or not)\nSelect a Reason code\nProvide Termination notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce the fields are populated, select to Terminate or Terminate with refund. All billing schedule lines will be terminated based on the date selected. \n\n\n\n\nOnce the Termination is complete, a notification will alert you to how many lines were terminated, and Termination can be removed from the account by selecting Remove termination in the ribbon.",

          "description": "When importing Workers into Dynamics 365 Human Resources (now in D365FO), you populate the Worker data entity with as much information as possible. Then, start the import using Data management and after the import is complete, you check Human resources > Workers > Workers, and there are no records to be found. The import says it was successful, so where did the worker records go?\nIf you look around, you will find them in the Workers without employment filtered view (Human resources > Workers > Workers without employment.) \n\n\n\n\n\nGreat, the records made it into the system, but I don't want to touch each record and add employment dates. How do we use the Data management functionality to add \"employment\" to these worker records?\n\n\nEmployment V2 Data Entity\n\n\nA data entity called Employment V2 allows you to update the Workers' employment through Data management instead of old-fashioned manual entry. The mapping for the Employment V2 Data entity looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe fields within the mapping of the Employment V2 data entity include: \n\n\nCalendarID\nDimensionDisplayValue\nEmploymentEndDate\nEmploymentStartDate\nLegalEntityID\nPersonnelNumber\nRegulatoryEstablishmentID\nWorkerType\n\n\n\nDepending on your setup, the data within the Employment V2 data entity can be as simple as this screenshot. \n\n\n\nOnce the Employment V2 data entity is imported, the Worker records will become active in the Human resources > Workers > Workers view in the Dynamics 365 Human Resources module.",
