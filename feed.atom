Step: 7 Complete the setup.











When you completed the setup, launch VM mode as shown in the image.















When VM started Type Password as shown in the image.

The purpose of this document is to demonstrate how we can we Get selected records in a grid on a form  X++ based on a business logic.
Product:
Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations.
Development approach:
Customization through CODE, we need to  get selected records in a grid on a form on clicked method to update values
Development:
Create a on clicked or clicked method to Get selected records in a grid on a form .







To get selected record(s) in a grid in AX, we use the MultiSelectionHelper class. To achieve that, follow the steps below:
1.  Create a command button on the form and override the clicked method.
2.  Insert the code below:





void clicked()
{
    MultiSelectionHelper          selectionHelper = MultiSelectionHelper::construct();//Create instance of class
    Set                           selectedRecords = new Set(Types::Record);//Declare a set of type record
    MyLinesTable                  tableLines; //Your table buffer
    super();


    selectionHelper.parmDataSource(MyLinesTable_DS); //Set the datasource
    tableLines  = selectionHelper.getFirst(); //assign to table buffer the reference to selected record(s)


    if (tableLines.RecId)
    {
        while (tableLines)
        {
            selectedRecords.add(tableLines);
            ttsbegin;

            tableLines.reason = "My Reason";
            tableLines.update();
            ttscommit;

            tableLines = selectionHelper.getNext();

            info(strFmt('Selected record.. %1',tableLines.myField));//Display selected record
        }
        MyLinesTable_DS.research();
        MyLinesTable_DS.refresh();

    }

It is often a requirement from the customer side to make the field mandatory on the forms for some users, user groups, and sometimes for all the users of the organization.
Let's take an example if we want to make Main Category field mandatory on the main account page. 


[extensionof(formdatasourceStr(MainAccount, MainAccount))]
internal final class COMPMainAccount_Extension
public boolean validateWrite()
 {
 boolean ret = next validateWrite();
 FormStringControl LedgerCategory = this.formRun().design().controlName("Ledger_Category") as FormStringControl;

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Args concept in dynamics ax is awesome. one can easily pass arguments from one Form to another Form with very less effort. Here, i am going to demonstrate how to pass Arguments from Form to Form. The Scenario is when I select one grid in Form A, that record will be passed to Form B and there Form B will received the whole record and filter it and will show.
Step 1: Make one SampleTable which has three fields named (SIno, name, ID).
Step 2: Make FormA with datasource as SampleTable and drag the datasource fields into the design Grid.
Step 3: Drag one button and override the click method and write the following code.
void clicked()
{
Args args;
FormRun formRun;
;
super();
args = new args(formstr(FormB)); // sending Args(record) to FormB
args.record(SampleTable);
formrun = classfactory.formrunclass(args);
formrun.init();
formrun.run();
formrun.wait();
formrun.detach();

}
step 4: Make FormB with datasource as same table for which you take for Form A i.e., SampleTable and drag the fields in to the
Grid of design part.
step 5: write the following code in to the init method of FormB.
public void init()
{
SampleTable _sampleTable;
super();
_sampleTable = element.args().record();
SampleTable_ds.query().dataSourceTable(Tablenum(SampleTable)).addRange(fieldNum(SampleTbl,RecId)).
value(SysQuery::value(_sampleTable.Recid));

The purpose of this document is to demonstrate how we can get value in view through computed column X++ based on a business logic.
Product:
Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, Platform Update 9.
Development approach:
Customization through View , we need to show Enum values  lable in view based on DimensionLedgerAccountType  from voucher transactions
Development:
Create a view and added GneralJournalEntry and GneralJournalAccountEntry data sources. added computed column for this added method to bring dimension values based on dim name. in our case bring value of "Business Unit"
Please find the method definition as follows.
public class Dimensionview extends common

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to add custom Execute action in the logic app.











In the drop-down, the system will display standard OData execute actions. To enable this, we need to create an OData execute action. 

This involves creating a method in the data entity and adding the following attribute at the top of the method.


        [SysODataActionAttribute("Name", false)]




 For a static method, we will pass 'false.' For an instance method, we need to pass 'true'.



Below code I have written in my custom entity.
[SysODataActionAttribute("GetSalesStatus", false)]
public static str getStatus(str    salesId, DataAreaId company)
{
    str  status;

    changecompany (company)
    {
	status = enum2Str(SalesTable::find(salesId).SalesStatus);
    }

    return  status;
} 



After rebuilding the project, it appears in the drop-down.








Sales ID and company are the input parameters. After selecting the execute action, click on 'Add parameter,' then select these two parameters and assign their respective values














In the blog below, he has explained OData actions with different scenarios. Please check for further clarification.   
OData actions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guys vote if you want Microsoft to add chat GPT by Open API integration with Dynamics 365 Finance and operation in upcoming release.



This blog is for ChatGPT and D365 Finance and operation integration, As we know so many people are talking about ChatGPT now a days and why don’t we try to access ChatGPT features from Dynamics 365 finance and operation and let user interact with AI to get required help.





Yes it is possible to with some C# and X++ code combination.
To start with I will suggest everyone to play with ChatGPT for sometime and understand. (New chat (openai.com))





If you feel now you are ready for technical integration, its time to jump on Playground and understand some technical stuff.



Playground – OpenAI API (To understand each parameters, Refer https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-gpt-3-openai-playground/, Blog.



Main parameters to understand.
1.Model,
2.Temperature (To fine tune output response)
3.Maximum length (Max output response)
4Top P,
5.Frequency Penalty
6.Presence penalty.
Once you understand more about parameter, It time to get API and secret key from beta.openai.com.
ApiCall = “https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/&#8221; + engine + “/completions”;
You can generate secret key from



Once you have all required information you can write C# code to integrate.


I have created D365 parameter table to store required parameters for ChatGPT API call.
Here you can find C# code for calling ChatGPT API.





You can refer same code in D365 and call using X++ reference.

Once you are done with above technical changes, Now we can proceed with parameters 


setup for API call and start playing with it

Here you have playground in D365 Finance and operation for your reference.

As a responsible technical I would suggest to have some restriction in place for responsible use of ChatGPT API if you wanted to implement same for customer.]]></summary>

When I built the project, I encountered 26 synchronization errors.

So, I checked 'This PC,' and I observed that the MSSQL (H) drive is full. Consequently, I followed the steps below to shrink the database



https://sql2014.wordpress.com/tag/logdata-disk-full/


Step 1: Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) as an administrator.
Step 2: Select the 'AXDB' database, right-click on it, and choose 'Properties.'

Step 3: In the Properties window, navigate to the 'Options' tab, select the 'Recovery model' as 'Simple,' and click 'OK.'

Step 4: Right-click on 'AXDB' again, select 'Tasks,' and then choose 'Shrink.' Under 'Shrink,' select 'Files.'

Step 5: Choose the file type as 'Log' and click 'OK.'

Step 6: Afterward, change the recovery model back to 'Full' and click 'OK.' (Rollback the step 3)

Usually, the primary key field of one table appears as a foreign key field of the related table. The table with the primary key is called the parent table. The table with the foreign key is called the child table.



A relation on a table can restrict the rows in the table or restrict the values that can be in a particular field. A common use of relations is to associate rows in one table with corresponding rows in another table. Relations enable many forms to display data from multiple tables. Some relations restrict the rows in the table by testing the values in each row against constant values. Other relations restrict the rows by comparing values …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, 
I have a requirement to update multiple records in F&O and send a response for each record using a logic app.


Please find the request and response in the below screenshot.




To archive my process I have followed the below steps.


1. I have utilized the 'When a HTTP request is received' trigger.




2. Initialized the 2 variables(Array, string type).




3. I have used a 'for-each' loop to iterate through each record, passing the HTTP response body as input. Inside the loop, I have parsed the current record.


4. After parsing, I updated the record in F&O using the 'update record' trigger.


5. If an update is successful, I am assigning a success status to the 'message' variable.
    If the update fails, I am parsing the error and sending it to the 'message' variable.



    While parsing the error I have used the below JSON.

    {
	"status": 400,
	"message": "An error has occurred.  Write failed for table row of type 'CustCustomerV3Entity'. Infolog: Warning: ",
	"error": {
		"message": "An error has occurred.  Write failed for table row of type 'CustCustomerV3Entity'. Infolog: Warning:"
	"source": "URL"
    }

    To fetch the above error use the below expression or parse JSON.

    outputs('Update_record')?['error']?['code'] 

    Status code:
    outputs('Update_record')?['statusCode']

 Afterward, I use 'Append to array variable' to create the response JSON and store it in the array.



6. Configure run after options for Append to the array variable has set up in the below.


7. After the for loop, I used the 'HTTP Response' action. In the response body, I converted the array into a JSON string.

json(string(variables('OutputJson')))


8. Open the 'For each' setting and setup like the below screenshot.





The output you will find in 1st screenshot.

The value of all cached methods is set when data is fetched from the back-end database. In addition, the value is refreshed when the reread method is called on the form data source.

Add a display Method to the Cache


Locate the form that the method is used on.

Expand the Data Sources node.

Right-click the data source that the method is associated with, and then select Override Method > init.

Call the FormDataSource.cacheAddMethod method after the call to super() in the init method.
The first parameter for cacheAddMethod determines the name of the method to be cached. The second parameter (set to true by default) determines whether the value of the display method is updated when a record is written to the database.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Extensible Data Security (XDS) policies allow restraint access to D365FO data in a very flexible way.
Business case: a user can see those purchase orders and their related confirmations only if he or she is Requester. The whole project can basically contain three objects: role, query, and policy.




After creating a specific security role, we need to create a query with HCMWorker table so that it is filtered for the current user.






All constrained tables should be added to the policy by referencing a particular relation (PurchTable, for example, has two relations with HCMWorker table; thus, we need to pick up the required one related to Requester field)








Note: we can create a join expression if a required relation does not exist for a given table.


Once the project built and synchronized, we can assign this new role along with some standard ones to a user. For example sake, I added Ada to my user.]]></summary>

                To create customers and vendors, instead of using the 'created record' trigger twice, I have created a new logic app. This logic app will be called from both places with the required inputs. In the child logic app, I have set the input parameters as mandatory.
In the screenshot provided, it shows that the 'Entity name' and 'Body' fields are marked as mandatory.







I have added the necessary code to make the 'Entity name' and 'Body' fields mandatory as highlighted in the screenshot.


After 'properties' I have added the 'required' tag and added the fields.

{
    "properties": {
        "EntityName": {
            "type": "string"
        },

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Open journal lines form from the custom form using x++.



We need to add ledgerJournalTable in the form data source and don't give any properties.
Copy the JournalLines_Review button from the LedgerJournalTable form.


Write the below code in the Form.

public class Form1 extends FormRun
{
    LedgerJournalFormTable  journalFormTable;

    public void init()
    {
        journalFormTable = LedgerJournalFormTable::construct(element);

        journalFormTable.datasourceInitPost(LedgerJournalTable);

        super();
    }

    JournalForm journalForm()
    {
        return journalFormTable;
    }
}




Button clicked method. (copied from LedgerJournalTable)

    [Control("MenuFunctionButton")]
    class JournalLines_Review
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Handles the Lines->Review button's clicked event.
        /// </summary>
        public void clicked()
        {
            journalFormTable.assertJournalNotInUse();
    
            journalFormTable.parmIsProcessingPaymentOnApprovedJounal(false);
            journalFormTable.parmIsWFApprovedModeSelected(true);
    
            super();
    
            ledgerJournalTable_ds.reread();
        }

    }


The below code I have written in jumpRef method is based on my requirement.


    [Control("String")]
    class Table1_FieldString1
    {
        public void jumpRef()
        {
            super();

            LedgerJournalTable  ledgerJournalTableNew = LedgerJournalTable::find(Table1.FieldString1);


            //ledgerJournalTable_ds.setRecord(ledgerJournalTableNew);

            ledgerJournalTable_ds.findRecord(ledgerJournalTableNew);

            //ledgerJournalTable_ds.reread();
            //ledgerJournalTable_ds.refresh();

            journalFormTable.datasourceInitPost(ledgerJournalTable_ds.cursor());

            JournalLines_Review.clicked();
        }
    }

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Usage
We can use pack-unpack methods in RunBaseBatch classes and all its descendants to save and/or store the state of an object, and then later re-instantiate the same object.
We need it, for example, to use the user's input for any batch job: some parameters can be used when a batch job is executed on the server. 
Documentation
Microsoft doc article is here.
Quote: "A reinstantiated object is not the same object as the one that was saved. It is just an object of the same class whose members contain the same information." 
You need to teleport your objects without a fly or other bugs.
Case examples
Basics
Basic example of such a class is Tutorial_RunbaseBatch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example we need to tie following datasources:
InventSum
    InventDim
        InventBatch


InventBatch unique key index consists of ItemId and InventbatchId, therefore we need to link Invnetbatch with both InventDim and InventSum. However, if you try to do it using addLink method:
qbdsInventBatch.clearDynalinks();
qbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventDim, inventBatchId), fieldNum(InventBatch, inventBatchId));
qbdsInventBatch.addLink(fieldnum(InventSum, ItemId), fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));
Invalid Field/Related field combination":


There are a few tricks how this can be resolved:


1. Create a view from InventSum and InventDim and use it as a single data source and then join InventBatch to it.
2. Start query from Inventbatch data source and then join to it InventSum and InventDim. However, considering the example above in most cases it will not be logical. But it might work in your case.
3. Use extended ranges. The solution will have the following look:
QueryBuildRange qbrItemId = SysQuery::findOrCreateRange(qbdsInventBatch, fieldNum(InventBatch, ItemId));
str itemIdRange = strFmt('(%1.%2=%3.%4)', qbdsInventBatch.name(), fieldStr(InventBatch, ItemId), _inventSum_DS_Query.dataSourceName(formDataSourceStr(InventOnhandItem, InventSum)).name(), fieldStr(InventSum, ItemId));
qbrItemId.value(itemIdRange);

Need to Export a database for safe keeping?
MSFT has had database movement APIs for some time but I haven't seen a lot of use of them. I thought I'd provide a simple Power Shell script to show what can be done. You can make this more user friendly or modern by putting it in Power Automate or using a Logic App. For reference, the API specs and available operations can be found at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dat...
 
Request A Database Backup
You can request a database backup on an environment like so:
# Update these values for your situation
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{DOMAIN}/oauth2/v2.0/token"       
USER@DOMAIN.COM}'
https://lcsapi.lcs.dynamics.com"
# Install Azure PowerShell
# Install D365FO.Tools
# Install D365FO.Integrations
Get-D365LcsApiToken -ClientId $ClientId -Username $Username -Password $Password -LcsApiUri $LcsApiUri -Verbose | Set-D365LcsApiConfig
Invoke-D365LcsDatabaseExport -ProjectId $ProjectId -SourceEnvironmentId $SourceEnvironmentId -BackupName $BackupName -LcsApiUri $LcsApiUri -Verbose
 
Using that as a starting point, you can use this script to create a pipeline. All variables at the top of the script should be changed for your specific scenario. In a pipeline, they can be added as pipeline variables and secured within the pipeline.

I could able to complete the data fields mapping process and try to start the map to initiate the data sync. However, it failed in testing due to some missing fields or columns.
I had almost no experience with Dual-write troubleshooting to resolve the issue. The only option left with me was to step-by-step approach right from Dynamics 365 FO Data entity to Dataverse table fields.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cannot find a particular term for this type of join; so I called it 'hanging left outer join'.


Let's state the problem.


We have two tables:
- LedgerJournalTrans (trans) with a field mgcProjId, which is a reference to ProjTable.
- mgcWarrantsDetails (details), which may have 0..N records for certain records from ProjTable.


Examples of data in both may look like the following:




If we apply standard outer join, the output will be as follows



But we need to print all details records by 'hanging' them against the same projId, like this



So, no duplicates from both tables must be present in the merged table.


This is how you can achieve it.

Source Control      

How to use Git with PackagesLocalDirectory
Git is a more modern source control system that has a lot of interest from Finance and Operations technical resources. There are a lot of potential benefits to use Git rather than TFVC. However, one of the hurdles to larger adoption of Git from X++ Devs is how Git really likes you to make new repos from an empty folder. If i want to sync to a new repo, Git would like that new repo to be a new folder on my local file system. F&O VMs are created with the PackagesLocalDirectory already there and full of code. So what can we do? Bodge something together. We can use Powershell to move the repo into a directory once we've synced …]]></summary>

How to create an Azure Key Vault for F&O
This is a simple, straight forward How-To to create an Azure Key Vault that can be used by Finance and Operations. At the end, you'll have an Azure Key Vault DNS URI name and a secret name (data points 7 and [4 or 9] referenced in other articles). Creating the secret names are explained in the article for the resource you are making the resource for. 
Start at https://portal.azure.com/
Search for "Key Vaults" and click on the Key Vaults option

Next, click create

Next, fill in the required sections.

Confirm your user is in the access policies list. click next.

Next, click on "selected networks" then "allow trusted Microsoft Services to bypass this firewall". Click next.

Click next

Click Create.

Wait for the resource to deploy then click "go to resource".

Record the Vault URI value for use later. Click on access policies.

Click Create.

Select "Get" and "List" in the Secret Management Operations section. Click next

Paste in the App Registration Application (Client) ID, add that principal, click next.

Click Next.

Click Create.

Next, click on Networking.

Add your IP address to the firewall.  You can use https://www.whatismyip.com/ to get  your IPv4 address.

Next, go to Secrets.

Click "Generate/Import".

Next, create a unique and descriptive name then paste in the secret. This is an example of creating a service bus connection string secret. Save the secret name assigned for later. Click Create.

Confirm service was created.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One thing I appreciate about subscriptions is the automatic renewal process. It's nice to sign up for a subscription and not have to worry about manually renewing every time the contract period is up. This brings in automatic revenue for the company and keeps the hassle of manually renewing out of everyone's hands. 
Fortunately, the process for setting up renewals in Subscription billing in Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations is fairly simple to execute as well. Let's dive in! 


Renewing Subscriptions
The process to renew a subscription set up in D365FO Subscription billing is done on the Billing schedule itself. When setting up your customer's billing schedule, there is a button to Renew automatically on the Billing schedule header. If this subscription should be renewed automatically, select this toggle and specify how many lines to add per renewal. 


Set the toggle for Renew automatically and specify how many lines to add per renewal


In my example above, I have a short billing cycle set for one quarter. I set the toggle for Renew automatically to Yes and Lines to add per renewal to 1. 
Once I invoiced the period, a new renewal line gets added to the Renewal section in the Line details for the line being renewed. The line shows who renewed it, the date it was renewed, and that it is, in fact, a renewal. 


See the renewals in Line details


If I navigate to View billing detail on the line, there is now a new billing line to be invoiced. This is the first automatic renewal line! 


Billing details now show a new line to be invoiced


Automatic renewals allow users to set up a billing schedule and continually renew the subscription until the customer decides to terminate it.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From time to time, we have all ended a subscription service. It happens - maybe the service doesn't meet your needs anymore. Perhaps it has gotten too expensive. Regardless of the reason, it is a common occurrence and Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance's Subscription billing module has a solution for terminating subscriptions.
Now you are probably thinking, "Oh great, something complex to add to my never-ending duties..." 
Nope! Terminating a Billing schedule in the Subscription billing module is easy, and I am going to walk through it. 


"I'll be back... when I am ready to subscribe again"


Terminating the Billing Schedule


Within the Billing schedule, you may notice that there are options surrounding Terminations. When you initially set up the Billing schedule, a Termination type will default onto the Billing schedule header. This field can be modified.




The three options are:



Adjust schedule
Bill remaining
No adjustment



The defaulted Termination type comes from the Recurring contract billing parameters found at Subscription billing > Recurring contract billing > Setup > Recurring contract billing parameters. 




Recurring contract billing parameters



Terminating Recurring Billing


Once on the Billing schedule screen for your Customer, there is an option to Terminate in the Billing schedule tab on the ribbon.





Once the Terminate dropdown is selected, there are options to: 



Select a Termination date
Select the Termination type
Select the Credit option
Choose to Prorate daily (or not)
Select a Reason code
Provide Termination notes






Once the fields are populated, select to Terminate or Terminate with refund. All billing schedule lines will be terminated based on the date selected. 




Once the Termination is complete, a notification will alert you to how many lines were terminated, and Termination can be removed from the account by selecting Remove termination in the ribbon.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often hear/see the words deprecate and depreciate used interchangeably, both in reference to ERP features and functionality. There is a difference in the words, and it's not just the letter i! This is a tough one, because even when you search on the internet, you get mixed results between the two. Let's look at the differences. 


This letter is not the only difference between these words!



Deprecate - There are several meanings behind the word deprecate, but as it relates to ERP system features and functionality, it means that the use of features and functionality are actively being discouraged because they have been superseded, or replaced, with different functionality. It doesn't necessarily mean the functionality is going away, but it will no longer be supported, and users are often actively encouraged to stop using it. 
Here is a link to D365FO's "Removed or deprecated features home page" - Removed or deprecated features home page - Finance & Operations | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Learn




Removed or deprecated features home page





Depreciate - This is a term used in finance, typically with fixed assets as it relates to D365FO, to show the diminishing value of the asset over a period of time.

How to Create an Azure Service Bus Queue

This is a simple, straight forward How-To to create an application registration that can be used by Finance and Operations. At the end, you'll have an Service Bus Host name, a queue name as well as a primary connection string (data points 6, 5, and 3 referenced in other articles).
Creating a Service Bus
First, go to https://portal.azure.com.
Next, search for Service Bus.

Next, click on create.

Next, fill out all of the required fields giving it a namespace name as well as a pricing tier. Standard pricing tier has lots of features but is very low cost.

Click Next.

Click Next.

Click Next. Note that some organizations may provide defaults values here or you may have to provide some depending on policy.

Click Create.

Wait until the resource deploy then click Go To Resource.

Record the Service bus host name in a safe place. This value will be referred to by other articles. Click on Shared Access Policies.

Click on RootManageSharedAccessKey.

Copy the value in Primary Connect String into a safe place. This value will be referred to by other articles. Close out of the SAS Policy.

Create A Queue
To Create a Queue in your Namespace, click on queues, Then click Queue, then give it a name. Record the name in a safe space. This value will be referred to other articles. Next, click Create.

Your queue should look like this.

Next, go to the Key vault and create a secret for the service bus connection string (Data Point 4).

How to Create an App Registration for F&O
 
This is a simple, straight forward How-To to create an application registration that can be used by Finance and Operations. At the end, you'll have an application ID as well as a secret value (data points 1 and 2 referenced in other articles).
First, go to https://portal.azure.com.
Next, search for app registrations and click on the first result

Next, click "new registration"

Next, give the app registration a name then click register.

Next, record the application (client) ID in a safe place. This will be referenced later several other articles. After that, click on Certificates & Secrets.

Next, Click on New Client Secret.

Next, enter a description and set when this will expire then click add.

Next, record the value in a safe place. This will be referenced later several other articles. This will only be visible right after adding the secret.

That's it.

Let's examine how to get the most out of Azure spend for Tier 1 machines.
A while ago Denis Trunin wrote an article on Visual Studio performance for F&O. I thought it was a well written and researched article. However, I wanted to see what the limit was on performance per unit of money spent. I also wanted to see what the limits were, in general. If twice as more is twice as better, then 4 times as much must mean 4 times more better, right? We'll be using the DOOM Super Shotgun methodology of 2 is better than 1, and 4 is better than 2. I'll also be likening each part of the article to a map from classic DOOM (1993). For those of you DOOM fans out the…]]></summary>

However, you may see benefit if you are part of an organization that pays for large subscriptions, memberships, or investments upfront and you require a methodology to defer these large expenses into an account then move these expenses from that deferred account into an expense account over a period of time. 


This new addition is not quite as obvious as the Revenue deferral piece discussed in the previous blog: Subscription Billing - Revenue Deferrals, but it is very powerful and can be leveraged in any organization!

Purpose of code reviews


Internal quality:


Overall approach – does the code do the right thing by proper means? 
Maintainability/extensibility – are we able to easily extend the solution, fix bugs etc.? 
Testability – are we able to test the code?
Documentation – are we able to understand why the code was made and what it does?
Performance – is the design correct from performance perspective? 


Functional testing: Some bugs are much more visible when looking into code
Knowledge sharing: Discussions between the developer and the reviewer

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When selling subscriptions, memberships, or prepaid investments, companies often receive large sums of money upfront from their customers and cannot recognize that revenue immediately. This can cause accounting and cashflow issues if the money was immediately available as revenue all at once. Therefore, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Finance offers Revenue and expense deferrals as part of their new Subscription billing offerings. Revenue deferral allows the revenue to enter a deferred account and be recognized on a schedule to be defined by the accounting team. Let's discuss how to set this up.


Deferral Defaults
The first step is to set up Deferral defaults. This section can be found in Subscription billing > Revenue and expense deferrals > Setup > Deferral defaults.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When setting up Subscription billing, there are two options for setting up the Recurring contract billing Invoice transaction type - Sales order or Free text invoice. 


Parameters
Within the Recurring contract billing parameters, you can specify which Invoice transaction type you'd like the Recurring contract billing to be. This will be the default whenever you create a new Recurring billing contract unless you modify it at the header level. 




Invoice transaction type setting in the Recurring contract billing parameters

So, what should you choose? 


Free text invoice
The benefits of using Free text invoice include:



No need for items, just type in the description
Can set the pricing to whatever you want (automatically defaults the line to Flat pricing method)
Specify Main account per line, or set up in Deferral defaults



The drawbacks of using Free text invoice include:



Cannot use trade agreements for pricing, as there are no items




Sales order
The benefits of using Sales order include:



Flexibility with pricing
Can use Tier and Flat tier pricing methods using trade agreements
Can automatically set deferrals on specific items and item groups that cannot be done at the Free text invoice level




The drawbacks of using Sales order include:



You have to set up items (some people find this tedious 😉)



Conclusion
If you have a simple, straightforward approach to billing subscriptions and don't mind a little bit of manual entry, then the Free text invoice is a clear winner. 


If you have complex pricing, prefer to use items, and want to set it and forget it, Sales order invoice is the clear winner for you!]]></summary>

Standard

The methodology behind a couple of these pricing methods can be a bit confusing, so I am here to help de-mystify them for you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When signing up for a subscription, there are often different methodologies of how to pay for that subscription. Similarly, companies require different methodologies for billing. For example, some companies bill for their services at a flat rate per period. Others may operate on a usage basis, such as $x.xx per hour used. Lastly, some billing occurs as a fixed amount that gets billed when the goods/services are fully consumed.

The Subscription billing module in Dynamics 365 for Finance offers the flexibility to bill using these different methodologies.

Here are a few tips and tricks to consider before ever importing your data:


Ensure the data formatting in Excel is consistent
Custom or Special data formats in Excel will not import properly, use standard formatting always
Data that was derived from formulas will likely generate an error message. Copy that data and paste it back in as values instead of a formula. 
Check spellings - especially on data that is validated by the system (Address/city names, Dropdown values, etc)

Transaction tracking mechanisms exist to ensure data integrity. I'm sure you have used either application before.

In Dynamics 365 for Finance, this is reflected by a Fixed-price project. Our accountants wish to book the advance payment invoice in the Balance sheet (Liability) and the partial or final invoice in the Profit & Loss section (Turnover). Yet in the case of a Fixed fee project, there is no difference between down, partial and final payments in standard Dynamics 365 for Finance: everything is a milestone with a certain amount. We suggest creating a special VAT group to control the Advance payment milestone ledger integration.

automation everywhere) in terms of data movement for Dynamics 365 Finance 
Operations. For the code ALM part, and even for RSAT, all the way it’s 
quite really easy to manage from development to release (especially thanks 
to Azure Dev Ops). But what about data / refresh / copy / backup and 
restore ? From many years now on, I was (as partner) trying to do it the 
more automatically I can for customers - and even me in fact... But as of 
today, and as a gift for the community, I release a brand new solution to 
install it and manage that without any MANUAL actions for all steps 
required for data movement ! I hope that it will help you a lot - like it 
will help me a lot for me, believe me - tons of hours saved. Let’s jump in

What is OCR? 
Optical Character Recognition. This is used to process documentation such as receipts and invoices by using Azure Cognitive Services to "read" the documentation and import the data into the system, cutting down on manual system entry.


Lifecycle Services
There is a component of installation that needs to be installed in your environment through Lifecycle Services (LCS). 
First, set up the Power Platform Integration. Use the standard template unless you are actively planning to use Dual-Write.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Above mentioned steps can be reduced to only one step i.e refresh of production DB to sandbox via LCS and later we can connect to sandbox environment directly from the development environment for debugging using below guide

Time required 20 minutes.
Steps

Enable access for your IP address
Go to lcs ->sandbox environment page. To connect to test environment RDP, you need to create Whitelist rule for your IP address 

Connect RDP and open SSMS

Connect to SQL server using Server name from LCS and add the prefix to SQL server name – servername.database.windows.net

Create a new query to test DB
Below query will create a new user that will be used for debugging
CREATE USER devtempuser WITH PASSWORD = ‘pass@word1’
EXEC sp_addrolemember ‘db_owner’, ‘devtempuser’


Whitelist your IP address
Select new query against Master DB
exec sp_set_firewall_rule N’DEVNAME’, ‘IP’, ‘IP’ 

Stop IIS, WWW service and Batch Service
Open IIS and stop the service. Open run and enter services.msc and stop WWW and Microsoft D365 batch service

Edit Web config
Go to C:\AosService\webroot\web.config and save the original file somewhere else as backup. Modify 4 Keys as per the below screenshot.
You can either comment original configuration or delete it and add new configuration of the sandbox environment

Start IIS and WWW services
Start IIS and WWW service stopped in step 5. Don’t start batch service.

Open the development environment AX URL
If you get 503 unavailable error, go to CMD(as admin) and type IISRESET

Debug
Now sandbox environment is connected to your development environment. You can simply open Visual studio to add breakpoints to X++ object and attach w3wp.exe service to debug.

        <updated>2022-06-30T01:58:00.002Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Union query may be a very efficient and useful option when you need to fetch similar data fields from different tables. A good example of this may be the case when you to gather information about project related transactions as they can be of different types, like, expenses, fees, items, etc. 
Say, we need to render some report collecting all these different types of transaction that can be posted against a given project and group them by a given financial dimension value in Project group. Let's see how Union query can help us.
In order to better understand the goal, you can take a look to the standard form ProjInvoiceJournal which perfectly explains how all these table relate to each other. 

Most of them contain the same set of fields, and we simply need to get some of them into one view to populate by the report data provider.
So, at the first step, let's create all necessary queries for the source Project transaction related tables. Pick up the first and create a simple query as depicted. 



Then create a view based on this query. 

Then pick up the next and do the same.


Complete these two steps for all necessary transaction types.
Now you can create a Union query and add all your views together as they have the same set of fields.


If you need to distinguish them later who is who, say, in computed column methods, you can use  unionAllBranchId field, but this is out of the current focus.

Finally you can elaborate it by adding a new view based on the latter with a simple SUM aggregation for Amount field.


Basically, you achieve your goal with no coding.
I am not going into details about the whole project, which you can get by this URL https://github.com/wojzeh/tmxProjectSalesPerSegment. Ping me, if you have any questions.

Fourteen years ago Vania Kashperuk created a class which became classics: SysMultiTableLookup. It made possible to create lookups based on multiple tables. Some people are still looking for it in vain among the standard classes. So I decided to create a new version of it for D365FO.
It combines supporting for both lookup and lookupReference methods: performFormLookup and performFormReferenceLookup.
Vania added a tutorial form to his class, so did I. There is a form in the project, which shows how unbounded form controls can be looked up with fields and display methods from joined tables as well as the case with aggregation and a CustTable data source to demonstrate a lookup for a reference group.

One way to acknowledge the team's devotion is by implementing a reward and recognition scheme.
The project leadership team often lacks understanding and support for the individual team members, which can lead to problems like crises that may arise during a project.
One way to motivate a team member is to support and encourage them. Part of leadership is making sure that everyone knows that you're standing alongside them and will be by their side as the project progresses.

Many system integrators need to handle projects with skills that they don't have. It is inevitable that they will face this problem at some point.
Before deploying any resources into the project, organizations must invest in training and skills development.
A project without refactoring will quickly become inefficient and error-prone. As a result, your team's morale will be lower, design & build phase time will increase, and your implementation success rate will be slowed down.
Although the team had a longer learning curve than anticipated, they were able to get up to speed quickly. This is because there was no formal training and few resources with experience.

Project estimation is a difficult task. There are many factors that can contribute to this difficulty, including the type of project, the team size, the level of experience and expertise of the estimators, and more. Lets understand some of these factors and pay attention as well as some guidance on how to estimate projects more accurately.
Many people believe that estimating projects is an art form or a skill set that can be developed over time with practice. However, it's also important to realize that estimating projects is not as easy as it seems and there are many factors at play when trying to come up with an accurate estimate for a project.
Another reason for the difficulty in estimating ERP projects is the lack of past data on…]]></summary>

Then, start the import using Data management and after the import is complete, you check Human resources > Workers > Workers, and there are no records to be found. The import says it was successful, so where did the worker records go?
If you look around, you will find them in the Workers without employment filtered view (Human resources > Workers > Workers without employment.) 





Great, the records made it into the system, but I don't want to touch each record and add employment dates. How do we use the Data management functionality to add "employment" to these worker records?


Employment V2 Data Entity


A data entity called Employment V2 allows you to update the Workers' employment through Data management instead of old-fashioned manual entry. The mapping for the Employment V2 Data entity looks like this:




The fields within the mapping of the Employment V2 data entity include: 


CalendarID
DimensionDisplayValue
EmploymentEndDate
EmploymentStartDate
LegalEntityID
PersonnelNumber
RegulatoryEstablishmentID
WorkerType



Depending on your setup, the data within the Employment V2 data entity can be as simple as this screenshot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something happened while I wasn't looking and now we have a clearer sequencing of Credit management Blocking rules. This has been a much-needed change, and I am happy to report on it!
Sequencing of Blocking Rules


In the past, Blocking rules in Credit management have all run, regardless of what happened on another Blocking rule. 
This could cause frustration if a company wanted to stop processing once specific criteria had been met. 
As of version 10.0.21, you may have noticed some new options within the Blocking rules form. 
When setting up Blocking rules, there is a new column within all Blocking rules labeled "Release sales order." This can only be enabled on an Exclusion rule type.


What this "Release sales order" toggle does, is it allows for an Exclusion rule to bypass all other Blocking rules and process the Sales order if it meets the Exclusion criteria. 
Typically, Blocking rules get processed before Exclusion rules, and an Exclusion rule on the same level as the Blocking rule will not exclude that Blocking rule. This is the exception to that rule. 


New Sequence of Blocking Rules


Exclusion rule with Release Sales order checked
Blocking rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)
Exclusion rules (Run in Table, Group, then All sequence)


Having rules in place surrounding how Blocking rules are run is a massive improvement. Here is the link to the documentation within Microsoft Docs: Credit holds for sales orders - Finance | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Docs]]></summary>

Bypass inventory reservations




A new parameter has appeared called Bypass inventory reservations, but what does it mean?




Release to Warehouse Credit Management Hold


There have been some observations made that when using the Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint, the Sales order gets stuck in an infinite loop of going back on Credit hold after being released. This is occurring even if the order is Released to warehouse within the grace days defined. 





The Release to warehouse Credit management checkpoint in Credit and collections parameters



Microsoft has quietly released a fix for this in version 10.0.19 that is called Bypass inventory reservations. When this is enabled in the Credit and collections parameters, it will disregard inventory reservations when checking credit management blocking rules. Likewise, it will enable checkpoint grace periods regardless of inventory reservation quantity. 





Enable the Bypass inventory reservations parameter to avoid the Release to warehouse credit hold loop!





This has been a lifesaver for people who have found themselves stuck in an endless loop of Credit management holds when they try to release their Sales order from Credit hold then try to Release to warehouse!]]></summary>
